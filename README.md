# Improved Google Marketing Tags Template for GTM
A Google Marketing Tags tag template with an improved UI that allows for greater flexibility for *Google Ads Conversion*, *Floodlight Pixel* and *Merchant Center* tags.

## Preface
This tag template won't be for everyone. This template is geared more toward GTM power users with advanced implementation practices that require a more robust UI for how variables are used inside of Google Ads Conversion and Floodlight tag from Google. This tag template took inspiration from [WebMechanix Improved GA4 Tag Template for GTM](https://github.com/WebMechanix/gtm-improved-ga4) created by [Derek Cavaliero](https://github.com/derekcavaliero) that used a similar UI pattern. Since all Google products now are shifting to using the Google Tag (gtag), it made sense to create this template using the GA4 Improved template as a foundation.

## What it does

1. Load the gtag.js library if needed.
2. Registers an arguments queue on the default `dataLayer` global.
3. Implements a better UI that accepts a variable that returns a JavaScript object with the fields/parameters/properties you want to set. This object will be merged with any additional fields you set via a normal key:value table. Any object key conflicts will always use the explicitly defined value in the key:value table.
4. (Experimental) Accepts multiple conversion pixels (Google Ads Conversions or Floodlight tags) in one tag leveraging [`gtag()` _send_to_ parameter](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/gtagjs/routing). In the same tag, we can add conversions for multiple Google Ads accounts, Campaign Manager 360, Display & Video 360, and so on.
5. (Experimental) Support for all Google Ads Conversion tag from Google (default template) features and the ones that are supported only using `gtag()`. Support for Floodlight tags as well.

## Example
Below you will find a possible configuration scenario for a tag with 3 Google Ads conversions, 1 Floodlight pixel and 1 Merchant Center event.

You can use all the parameters that are listed in `gtag` documentation for these tags.

## Caveat

One point of caution here is that: since we are using `gtag`, it has the power to trigger GTM triggers if the event name used in the `gtag` call is an event used by a GTM trigger.

Reason: `gtag` is nothing more than a data layer push 
```js
window.gtag = function() { window.dataLayer.push(arguments); }.
```

Example: the call `gtag('event', 'purchase', { ... })` can trigger triggers that expect the event **'purchase'**. Whereas the call to `gtag('event', 'conversion', { ... })` can trigger triggers that expect the event **'conversion'**.

By default, the **'conversion'** event was left configured, as suggested by Google Ads documentation. However, the same caution applies: be sure to check for triggers that fire on this event.

Note that native Google Ads conversion tags in GTM use the **'purchase'** event. Nevertheless, no problems were identified in using **'conversion'** as the event name.

However, if product information is passed in the tag (via the `items` parameter), the template will use the **'purchase'** event, as mandated by the documentation. Here it is necessary to be careful, as it will trigger some triggers that expect the **'purchase'** event.

ðŸ’¡
To address this issue, simply create a variable of type *Data Layer* using the `eventModel.from_gtm_template` variable from the data layer (this template inserts this key in all its events).

- In the trigger, this variable should be inserted with the comparison *does not equal true*.
- Or, if you don't want to modify the original trigger, you can use an exception trigger. Add this variable to it with the comparison *equals true*.

## Limitations

### dataLayer
Google's Sandboxed Javascript doesn't allow for the ability to customize what global variable is used for the arguments queue. If you need to specify a non-default dataLayer global, you will need to edit the template file `dataLayerName` constant to your needs.

### gtag.js is loaded from www.googletagmanager.com
Google's Sandboxed Javascript doesn't allow for the ability to customize what domain and path is used to load the `gtag.js` library. If you wish to load the `gtag.js` file in a non-default way (e.g. proxy through a sGTM container or other 1st party means) you will need to edit the template file at this time.

### Built-in consent checks
This tag template has not yet been adjusted to use built-in consent checks for things like consent-mode that the default GA4 tag templates do.
